# The Power of Plants

Moving to a plant-based diet doesn't mean sacrificing protein. In fact, many plant sources are packed with essential amino acids.

## 1. Lentils
Lentils are a nutritional powerhouse. They are rich in:
*   Protein
*   Fiber
*   Iron

> **Tip:** Soak lentils overnight to reduce cooking time and improve digestibility.

## 2. Quinoa
Unlike most plant proteins, quinoa is a **complete protein**, meaning it contains all nine essential amino acids.
