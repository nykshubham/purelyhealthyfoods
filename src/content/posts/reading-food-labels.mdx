# Reading Between the Lines

Food labels can be confusing. Here is what you need to look for.

## Serving Size
Always check the serving size first. All the numbers follow this amount.

## Added Sugars

*   High Fructose Corn Syrup
*   Cane Sugar
*   Agave Nectar

These are all forms of added sugar.
