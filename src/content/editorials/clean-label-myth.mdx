In recent years, the "clean label" movement has transformed from a niche preference to a dominant market force. While the desire for transparency is commendable, the demonization of "chemical-sounding" ingredients—regardless of their safety or utility—has led to a paradox where less safe, less stable foods are perceived as superior.

## The Chemophobia Epidemic

Take **Ascorbic Acid**, for example. It is simply Vitamin C, used as a preservative. Yet, some brands replace it with "Acerola Cherry Extract" to avoid the chemical name, often at a higher cost and lower consistency.

> "A chemical name does not equate to toxicity. Water is Dihydrogen Monoxide. Everything is chemicals."

## The Cost of Fear

By reformulating products to remove standard stabilizers like Xanthan Gum (a fermented sugar product), companies often turn to more resource-intensive alternatives. This drives up food prices disproportionately affecting lower-income populations who simply need safe, affordable nutrition.

It is time we judge food by its nutritional density and safety profile, not by the number of syllables in its ingredient list.
