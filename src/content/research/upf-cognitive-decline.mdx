**Study:** *Association Between Ultra-Processed Food Consumption and Cognitive Decline*  
**Journal:** *JAMA Neurology*  
**Published:** July 2025

## Abstract

A prospective cohort study following 10,775 adults (ages 35-74) found that individuals whose diet consisted of more than 20% ultra-processed foods (UPFs) showed a 28% faster rate of global cognitive decline compared to those who consumed less than 10%.

## Methodology

Participants were evaluated using:
1.  Food Frequency Questionnaires (FFQ) every 4 years.
2.  Cognitive batteries testing memory, verbal fluency, and executive function.

## Key Findings

*   **Dose-Response:** The effect was dose-dependent.
*   **Specific Categories:** Processed meats and sugary beverages showed the strongest negative correlation.
*   **Mechanism:** Researchers hypothesize that systemic inflammation and microvascular changes are the primary drivers.

## Clinical Implication

While correlation does not equal causation, this study adds to the growing body of evidence suggesting that limiting UPF intake is a viable strategy for preserving long-term brain health.
