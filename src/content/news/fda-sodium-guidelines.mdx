**Washington, D.C.** — The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has announced a new set of voluntary sodium reduction targets for the food industry, aiming to combat the rising prevalence of hypertension and cardiovascular disease.

## The Scope of the Guidelines

The new guidance applies to over 160 categories of commercially processed, packaged, and prepared foods. The goal is to reduce average daily sodium intake from approximately 3,400 mg to 3,000 mg.

> "Sodium-related diet diseases are a leading cause of death in the U.S. Modest reductions can have significant public health impacts," stated the FDA Commissioner.

## Industry Response

Major food manufacturers have expressed willingness to cooperate, though some trade associations warn of technical challenges in preserving flavor and shelf stability in certain product categories like cured meats and cheeses.

### Key Targets:
*   **Breads & Rolls:** 10% reduction.
*   **Cold Cuts:** 15% reduction.
*   **Soups:** 12% reduction.

Consumers are advised to check Nutrition Facts labels as these changes are implemented over the coming months.
