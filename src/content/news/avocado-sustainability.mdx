**Mexico City** — The skyrocketing global demand for avocados is putting immense pressure on water resources in Latin America. It takes an estimated 320 liters of water to grow a single avocado, leading to aquifer depletion in arid regions.

Certification bodies are now proposing a "Water Footprint" label for high-impact crops to help eco-conscious consumers make informed choices. Chefs and restaurants are also exploring localized alternatives, such as broad bean mashes, to reduce reliance on imported avocados.
