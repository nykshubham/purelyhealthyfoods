**Sydney** — A new study suggests that **vitamin C**, one of the most common antioxidants, may help protect the lungs from the harmful effects of fine particulate air pollution (PM2.5), which is linked to asthma, reduced lung function, and increased risk of lung cancer.

Researchers from the **University of Technology Sydney (UTS)** conducted controlled experiments on male mice and lab-grown human tissues, exposing them to PM2.5 and then testing the effects of vitamin C supplementation. The findings were published in *Environment International*.

## What the Study Found

The research team reports that vitamin C helps counter oxidative stress — the cellular damage caused when fine particles enter the respiratory system. Recommended doses reduced lung inflammation, preserved mitochondrial structure, and improved the activity of key antioxidant enzymes such as **SOD2** and **GPX4**.

These effects suggest that vitamin C could support lung function and reduce some respiratory symptoms triggered by pollutant exposure.

> “Antioxidant vitamin C supplementation was effective in mitigating the adverse effects of low-level PM2.5 exposure, which may be recommended to high-risk individuals,” the authors note, as cited by Science Alert.

## Expert Caution

UTS molecular biologist **Brian Oliver** emphasised that while the results are promising, supplementation must be medically guided.

He stated that the highest safe dose *may* offer benefits but warned that over-the-counter supplements often contain additional compounds, increasing risks of accidental overdose or interactions with medication.

## A Possible Low-Cost Preventive Approach

Researchers say these findings point toward a potential low-cost preventive measure for populations exposed to polluted environments, especially in regions affected by urban emissions or bushfires.

However, experts stress that this does not replace broader air-quality interventions, nor is vitamin C a cure. It may serve as a supportive strategy — but only under a doctor’s supervision.

Air pollution remains a global public-health emergency, and as Oliver notes, **“there is no safe level of air pollution.”**
