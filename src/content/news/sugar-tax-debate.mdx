**London** — The World Health Organization (WHO) has renewed calls for nations to implement taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), citing new evidence that such fiscal policies effectively reduce consumption and lower the prevalence of type 2 diabetes.

Critics from the beverage industry argue that these taxes disproportionately affect low-income households and do not address the complex root causes of obesity. However, proponents point to successful case studies in Mexico and the UK, where tiered levies have incentivized manufacturers to reformulate products with less sugar.
