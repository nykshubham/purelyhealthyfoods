**New Delhi** — Many everyday foods that appear wholesome—like biscuits, brown breads, rolls and cereals—quietly contain **maida**, the refined flour often called “white poison” for its low nutritional value and high glycemic impact.

Maida is produced by finely milling wheat while stripping away the bran and germ. This leaves behind mostly starch, which spikes blood sugar and offers almost no vitamins, minerals, or fibre. Industrial processing may also involve bleaching agents like *benzoyl peroxide* to achieve its white appearance.

## Why Maida Is a Health Concern

Regular consumption of maida-heavy foods contributes to increased blood glucose, weight gain, and reduced metabolic health. Despite the “healthy” labels, refined flour remains a dominant ingredient in many daily items.

## Foods That Commonly Hide Maida

### **1. Biscuits & Cookies**
Even products marketed as “oat” or “multigrain” typically use maida as the primary base for structure and shelf life.

### **2. Pizza Bases**
Most commercial pizza bases rely heavily on refined flour unless they clearly specify whole-wheat or alternative crusts.

### **3. Wraps & Rolls**
Veggie wraps, kathi rolls and ready-made tortillas often contain high proportions of maida, even when sold as “whole wheat”.

### **4. Cakes & Muffins**
The soft crumb in muffins and cakes comes from refined flour paired with sugar and fats—nutritionally empty combinations.

### **5. Puffs, Patties & Samosas**
The flaky layers in patties and puff pastries are possible only because of maida-based dough.

### **6. Croissants**
Traditional croissants use multiple layers of maida dough and butter, making them high in refined carbs and unhealthy fats.

### **7. Breakfast Cereals**
Many packaged breakfast cereals secretly use refined flour. Reading ingredient lists is essential for identifying whole-grain options.

### **8. Breads**
Brown bread or multigrain bread often contains mostly maida with only traces of whole grains unless the label explicitly states “100% whole wheat”.

Consumers can avoid hidden maida by checking labels carefully and choosing genuinely whole-grain or alternative-flour options.
