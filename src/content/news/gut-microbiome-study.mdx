**Boston** — Researchers at Harvard Medical School have identified specific gut bacteria strains that produce neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine, directly influencing mood and anxiety levels.

The study, published in *Nature Microbiology*, suggests that dietary interventions targeting microbiome diversity could become a standard adjunctive therapy for depression. "We are moving from a brain-centric view of mental health to a whole-body ecosystem approach," says lead author Dr. Elena Rossi.
